Android Fit History Api Sample
============

A simple example of how to use the History API on the Android Fit platform.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android API Level > 9
- Android Build Tools v23
- Android Support Repository
- Register a Google Project with an Android client per getting started instructions
  http://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

NOTE: You must register an Android client underneath a Google Project in order for the Google Fit
API to become available for your app. The process ensures your app has proper consent screen
information for users to accept, among other things required to access Google APIs.
See the instructions for more details: http://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started

Support
-------

The most common problem using these samples is a SIGN_IN_FAILED exception. Users can experience
this after selecting a Google Account to connect to the FIT API. If you see the following in
logcat output then make sure to register your Android app underneath a Google Project as outlined
in the instructions for using this sample at: http://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started

`10-26 14:40:37.082 1858-2370/? E/MDM: [138] b.run: Couldn't connect to Google API client: ConnectionResult{statusCode=API_UNAVAILABLE, resolution=null, message=null}`
